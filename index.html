										June 2020 - September 2020 | Software Engineering Intern

								<p>
									<b>What is Facebook?</b><br />
									Unless you have been living in isolation without access to the internet for the past decade,
									I don't think there needs to be much explanation here. However, during my internship, I worked
									on the Creation Growth Team at Facebook which is in charge of all of increasing the growth of
									users onto their family of products. 
								</p>
								<p>
									<b>What did I do?</b><br />
									During my internship, I implemented a new feature for users to share videos onto their Facebook
									story via third-party apps. This included a video player for users to preview their videos
									prior to posting on their stories. Moreover, I also implemented basic editing features to give users 
									the flexibility of posting exactly what they want to their stories like a mute and trim feature. This
									ultimately increased the number of videos posted to Facebook story per day.

									<h4>Zillow Group</h4>
									<p>
										June 2019 - September 2019 | Software Engineering Intern
									</p>
								</header>
								<p>
									<b>What is Zillow Offers?</b><br />
									At Zillow Group, I interned on the <a href="https://www.zillow.com/offers/"
									target="_blank">Zillow Offers</a> Renovation (will be known as 'ZO Reno'
									henceforward) team based in Irvine, California. Zillow Offer is a program within
									ZillowGroup where homeowners are able to ask Zillow to make an offer to buy their
									home. The ZO Reno team creates all of the software used by estimators,
									superintendents, and renovators during the renovation process after the home has
									been purchased by Zillow.
								</p>
								<p>
									<b>What did I do?</b><br />
									During my internship, I created a full stack application that helped superintendents
									interpret their renovation data better. With many renovations being done daily, it
									can be hard for superintendents to keep track of all properties that need
									renovation. Using this renovation data, I built a dashboard web application that
									displays trends and correlations to supply superintendents with more insight about
									the renovations happening within each market. This can help them catch red flags
									early on and improve on markets that are lacking in renovations.

									<h4>International Data Group (IDG)</h4>
									<p>
										June 2018 - September 2018 | Software Engineering Intern
									</p>
								</header>
								<p>
									<b> What is IDG? </b><br />
									<a href="https://www.idg.com/" target="_blank">IDG</a> is a tech-media company that
									owns a lot of mediums like <a href="https://www.macworld.com"
										target="_blank">Macworld</a>, <a href="https://www.javaworld.com/"
										target="_blank">Javaworld</a>, <a href="https://www.cio.com"
										target="_blank">CIO</a>, etc. On top of these websites, IDG also owns a numerous
									number of internal applications for writers to make blogs and posts within these
									sites.
								</p>
								<p>
									<b> What did I do? </b><br />
									While I was interning at IDG, I played a developer role on the QA team. I built the
									QA team an automated testing framework using Selenium to automate all of their
									regression tests. The coverage on these automation tests included all domains owned
									by IDG, internal web applications used by writers, and internal APIs used by these
									applications,thus increasing the overall bug detection and effiency of the QA team.

					<h3>As a Teacher...</h3>
					<p>Last year, I was given a great oppurtunity to become a teaching assistance within the Computer
						Science department at the University of Washington -- Seattle. Although it can be nerve-racking
						to stand in front of 30+ students every week to teach a lesson, I love the idea of giving back
						to the CS community. I love the ability to help my peers in classes that I once previously
						struggled in, and I plan to continue being a TA within the department every quarter until I
						graduate! </p>

												<p>
													This quarter I am going back to working with Discrete Math students! However, this does not mean that my job will be easier because I have taught it before. This quarter has presented new challenges for this course that I am excited to adapt to. Because of the recent pandemic of COVID-19, this entire course will be taught virtually for the first time. I have never taught a class virtually before but I am motivated to give the same quality of education to these students given these circumstances. Moreover, I plan to improve on my lesson plans that I have previously created to help students see the connections between computer science and discrete math!

													This was my first time becoming a teaching assistant for Systems programming
                                                    and I enjoyed teaching this course. The content for this course is
                                                    in a completely different area of Computer Science than
                                                    what I am normally used to. I am (relatively) comfortable with
                                                    teaching theoretical computer science courses as I have been
                                                    teaching those types of courses for many quarters now, so it was very rewarding
                                                    to tackle new challenges with teaching a course that is
                                                    programming-heavy and more project-based (rather than proof-based).

													Discrete math is the first course that students have to take within

													During this quarter, I taught students that had little to no

													that they would not be intimidated with programming.
													<br /> <br />Some of the responsibilities include:

														<li>Graded over 25 programming submissions each week to enforce
															good coding conventions</li>
														<li>Taught weekly classes of 25 on introductory computer science
															concepts</li>
														<li>Troubleshot and debugged over 100 students' code regarding
															syntax, logic, and implmentation weekly</li>
														<li>Enhancing students knowledge of what programming is</li>
